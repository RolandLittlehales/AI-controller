## RFC 2119 Keywords

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Quality Tools and Configuration

### ESLint Configuration

Code MUST adhere to the ESLint configuration defined in `eslint.config.js`:

- **TypeScript Rules**: Code MUST NOT contain unused variables (except those prefixed with `_`), and SHOULD minimize the use of `any` types
- **Vue Rules**: Multi-word component names are OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED for clarity
- **General Rules**: Code MUST NOT contain `debugger` statements in production, SHOULD use `const` over `let` where applicable, and MUST NOT use `var`

### TypeScript Configuration

All TypeScript code MUST comply with the strict configuration in `tsconfig.json`:

- **Strict Mode**: REQUIRED for all TypeScript files
- **Type Safety**: Code MUST NOT have unchecked indexed access or implicit any types
- **Module System**: Code MUST use ES modules with isolated modules compilation
- **Consistency**: File naming MUST be consistent across platforms

### Testing Configuration

Testing MUST follow the Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.ts`:

- **Environment**: Tests MUST run in the happy-dom environment
- **Coverage**: Code MUST maintain minimum 80% coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **Setup**: Tests MUST use the global setup file at `test/setup.ts`

## Code Style and Formatting

### Formatting Standards

- Code MUST be formatted using Prettier with the project configuration
- Line length SHOULD NOT exceed 120 characters
- Indentation MUST use 2 spaces (no tabs)
- Trailing whitespace MUST be removed
- Files MUST end with a newline character

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables and Functions**: MUST use camelCase
- **Constants**: MUST use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for module-level constants
- **Classes and Interfaces**: MUST use PascalCase
- **Files**: MUST use kebab-case for Vue components, camelCase for TypeScript files
- **Directories**: MUST use kebab-case

### Import Organization

Imports MUST be organized in the following order:

1. Node.js built-in modules
2. Third-party dependencies
3. Internal modules (using `@/` or `~/` aliases)
4. Relative imports

Each group MUST be separated by a blank line.

## TypeScript Standards

### Type Safety Requirements

- Code MUST NOT use `any` types except when interfacing with untyped third-party libraries
- All function parameters and return types MUST be explicitly typed
- Object properties MUST be typed using interfaces or type aliases
- Generic types SHOULD be used for reusable components and utilities

### Type Definitions

- Interface definitions MUST be placed in the `types/` directory
- Type definitions MUST be exported from a central `types/index.ts` file
- Types MUST be documented with JSDoc comments for complex interfaces
- Union types SHOULD be preferred over enums when appropriate

### Error Handling

- Functions that can fail MUST return Result types or throw typed exceptions
- Error types MUST be defined in the `types/` directory
- Async functions MUST handle Promise rejections appropriately
- Error messages MUST be descriptive and actionable

## Testing Standards

### Test Organization

- Tests MUST be co-located with their source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extensions
- Test files MUST follow the same naming convention as their source files
- Shared test utilities MUST be placed in the `test/` directory

### Test Quality Requirements

- **Integration Over Unit**: Tests SHOULD focus on integration scenarios rather than isolated unit tests
- **User Journey Testing**: Tests MUST validate complete user workflows
- **Minimal Mocking**: Tests SHOULD only mock external dependencies (APIs, browser APIs, third-party libraries)
- **Coverage**: Each file MUST maintain minimum 80% code coverage

### Test Patterns

#### DO Mock (External Dependencies)
- External system APIs (`node-pty`, file system operations)
- Browser APIs (`WebSocket`, `window.location`, `process` global)
- Third-party libraries (`@xterm/xterm`, `@xterm/addon-*`)
- Network requests to external services

#### DON'T Mock (Internal Code)
- Internal services and utilities
- Logger utility (allow real logging during tests)
- Vue components (use real components when possible)
- Internal business logic

### Test Structure

Tests MUST follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern:

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should handle user interaction correctly', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const wrapper = mount(Component, { props: { ... } })
    
    // Act
    await wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')
    
    // Assert
    expect(wrapper.emitted('event')).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

## Code Review Standards

### Review Process

All code changes MUST undergo peer review before merging:

1. **Automated Checks**: All CI quality gates MUST pass
2. **Manual Review**: At least one peer reviewer MUST approve changes
3. **Documentation Review**: Changes affecting APIs MUST include documentation updates
4. **Testing Review**: New features MUST include comprehensive tests

### Review Criteria

Reviewers MUST evaluate:

- **Correctness**: Code functions as intended
- **Performance**: No unnecessary performance regressions
- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced
- **Maintainability**: Code follows established patterns
- **Documentation**: Changes are properly documented

### Quality Gates

Before code review, the following MUST pass:

```bash
pnpm lint        # 0 errors, 0 warnings
pnpm typecheck   # 0 TypeScript errors
pnpm test        # 100% test success rate
pnpm build       # Successful production build
```

## Performance Requirements

### Bundle Size

- Main bundle size MUST NOT exceed 1MB gzipped
- Individual route chunks SHOULD NOT exceed 500KB gzipped
- Tree-shaking MUST be enabled for all dependencies
- Unused code MUST be eliminated from production builds

### Runtime Performance

- Initial page load MUST complete within 3 seconds on 3G networks
- Time to Interactive (TTI) MUST be under 5 seconds
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) MUST be under 2 seconds
- Core Web Vitals MUST meet Google's "Good" thresholds

### Memory Management

- Memory leaks MUST be prevented in long-running applications
- Event listeners MUST be properly cleaned up
- WebSocket connections MUST be properly closed
- Terminal instances MUST be properly disposed

## Security Standards

### Input Validation

- All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized
- Terminal commands MUST be validated before execution
- File paths MUST be validated to prevent directory traversal
- WebSocket messages MUST be validated against defined schemas

### Authentication and Authorization

- Session management MUST be secure (when implemented)
- API endpoints MUST validate authorization (when implemented)
- Sensitive data MUST NOT be logged or exposed in client-side code
- Environment variables MUST be used for sensitive configuration

### Dependency Security

- Dependencies MUST be regularly updated to address security vulnerabilities
- Dependency audits MUST be performed monthly using `pnpm audit`
- High-severity vulnerabilities MUST be addressed within 7 days
- Security advisories MUST be monitored and acted upon

### Code Security

- `eval()` and similar dynamic code execution MUST be avoided
- Content Security Policy (CSP) MUST be implemented
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention MUST be enforced
- SQL injection prevention MUST be implemented (when applicable)

## Code Complexity and Maintainability

### Complexity Metrics

- Cyclomatic complexity SHOULD NOT exceed 10 for individual functions
- File length SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines
- Function length SHOULD NOT exceed 50 lines
- Nesting depth SHOULD NOT exceed 4 levels

### Maintainability Principles

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Solutions SHOULD be as simple as possible
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Code duplication SHOULD be minimized
- **SOLID Principles**: Object-oriented code SHOULD follow SOLID principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Functions and classes SHOULD have a single, clear purpose

### 9.2 KISS Principle Implementation Guidelines

When applying KISS principles to code simplification:

**✅ DO:**
- Simplify implementation complexity while preserving exact visual appearance
- Remove unnecessary code that doesn't affect functionality
- Use direct approaches instead of overly complex abstractions
- Test visual changes with browser/playwright to ensure no regressions

**❌ DON'T:**
- Change visual design when asked to simplify code complexity
- Remove CSS classes without verifying template usage
- Conflate code simplification with design changes
- Assume "simplify" means "change how it looks"

**Key Insight:** "Simplify" means easier to maintain code, not different visual appearance

### Refactoring Indicators

Code MUST be refactored when:

- Complexity metrics exceed defined thresholds
- Duplicate code patterns are identified
- Performance bottlenecks are detected
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered

## Pre-commit Hooks and Automation

### Pre-commit Requirements

The following checks MUST run before each commit:

1. **Linting**: `pnpm lint` with no errors or warnings
2. **Type Checking**: `pnpm typecheck` with no errors
3. **Testing**: `pnpm test` with 100% success rate
4. **Formatting**: Code MUST be formatted with Prettier

### Automation Tools

- **Husky**: SHOULD be used for Git hooks
- **lint-staged**: SHOULD be used for staged file processing
- **GitHub Actions**: MUST be used for CI/CD automation
- **Dependabot**: SHOULD be enabled for dependency updates

## Continuous Integration Quality Gates

### Build Pipeline

All changes MUST pass the following CI stages:

1. **Install**: Dependencies install successfully
2. **Lint**: No linting errors or warnings
3. **Type Check**: No TypeScript compilation errors
4. **Test**: All tests pass with required coverage
5. **Build**: Production build completes successfully
6. **Security Scan**: No high-severity vulnerabilities

### Quality Metrics

The CI pipeline MUST enforce:

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% across all metrics
- **Build Time**: Complete pipeline under 10 minutes
- **Bundle Analysis**: No unexpected bundle size increases
- **Performance Budget**: Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges

### Failure Handling

- Failed builds MUST block merging
- Flaky tests MUST be investigated and fixed within 24 hours
- Security scan failures MUST be addressed before merging
- Performance regressions MUST be investigated and resolved

## Refactoring and Technical Debt

### Technical Debt Management

- Technical debt MUST be documented in code comments or issue tracking
- Debt paydown MUST be planned and scheduled regularly
- Legacy code MUST be incrementally improved
- Breaking changes MUST be communicated and documented

### Refactoring Guidelines

- Refactoring MUST NOT change external behavior
- Refactoring MUST be covered by existing tests
- Large refactoring SHOULD be broken into smaller, reviewable changes
- Performance impacts MUST be measured and validated

### Code Review for Refactoring
