### üöÄ Ready for Phase 1.3
The project is ready to move to Phase 1.3 (Core API Development) with:
- Terminal WebSocket communication working
- Basic terminal functionality implemented
- Solid foundation for API expansion

## Development Workflow

When starting any new development work, follow this essential workflow:

### 1. Branch Management
- **Always** create a new branch off of main first before starting any work
- Use descriptive branch names that reflect the feature/task being worked on

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- Think **ultra deeply** about the requirements before proceeding
- If anything seems missing or unclear, **pause and ask** for clarification
- Consider the current state of the codebase before making changes
- Understand the context and impact of the proposed changes

### 3. Solution Design
- Brainstorm multiple different solutions that would best fit the requirements
- Keep solutions **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Note: Tests should be **WET** (Write Everything Twice) for clarity and comprehensiveness
- **Always include tests** for any code written - use **Vitest** as the testing framework
- Prefer **integration tests** over unit tests
- **MUST** Mock only what's absolutely necessary (external APIs, etc.)

### 4. Solution Iteration
- Review each solution for correctness and fit
- If not correct enough, restart the solution loop
- Iterate until you find a truly good solution
- Don't settle for "good enough" - aim for the right solution

### 5. Implementation Process
- Build, test, and check types continuously as you implement
- Run tests and builds at every **main milestone** of the work
- Perform **sanity checks every 30 minutes**: test, types, verify you're on the correct path
- Ensure adherence to KISS, DRY/WET principles throughout

### 6. Final Review
- Once implementation is complete and confirmed working, perform a **self code review**
- Focus on:
  - **Correctness**: Does it work as intended?
  - **KISS**: Is it as simple as possible?
  - **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - no over-engineering
  - **DRY/WET**: Proper balance between DRY code and WET tests
  - **Nuance**: Are there subtle considerations addressed?
  - **General best practices**: Any other relevant quality factors

## Build & Development Commands

The following commands are available for development:

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start development server
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm preview          # Preview production build
pnpm generate         # Generate static site

# Code Quality
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm lint:fix         # Run ESLint with auto-fix
pnpm typecheck        # Run TypeScript type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run Vitest tests
pnpm test:ui          # Run Vitest with UI

# Package Management
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm postinstall      # Run Nuxt prepare (runs automatically)
```

### Important Setup Step

After running `pnpm install`, you MUST rebuild node-pty native bindings:
```bash
cd node_modules/.pnpm/node-pty@1.0.0/node_modules/node-pty && npm rebuild
```

**Why npm rebuild instead of pnpm?** Even though we use pnpm as our package manager, rebuilding native bindings inside the node_modules directory requires npm rebuild because that's what node-pty's build scripts expect. The pnpm rebuild command works differently and won't properly compile the native bindings in nested directories.

This is required because node-pty has native bindings that must be compiled for your platform.

## Development Guidelines

### Technology Stack (Implemented)
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Nuxt UI
- **Backend**: Nitro with WebSocket support
- **Terminal**: xterm.js + node-pty + Socket.IO
- **Styling**: Vanilla Extract + Nuxt UI components
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict mode

### Architecture Patterns
- **Component-based**: Vue 3 Composition API
- **Server-side**: Nitro API routes with WebSocket support
- **Real-time communication**: Socket.IO for terminal I/O
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Service layer**: Separate terminal service for business logic

### Current API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `WS /api/ws/terminal` - WebSocket terminal communication

### Testing Strategy (CRITICAL - FOLLOW THESE RULES)
- **Framework**: Vitest with coverage enabled (80% minimum per file)
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% statements, branches, functions, lines (perFile: true)
- **Focus**: User journey testing over isolated unit tests
- **Philosophy**: Test integration flows rather than individual methods

#### MINIMAL MOCKING APPROACH - ONLY MOCK WHAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
**‚úÖ DO MOCK (External dependencies outside our control):**
- External system APIs: `node-pty` (spawns real OS processes)
- Browser APIs: `WebSocket`, `window.location`, `process` global
- Third-party libraries: `@xterm/xterm`, `@xterm/addon-*` (browser terminal emulation)
- Time/Date functions when testing specific timing behavior
- Network requests to external services

**‚ùå DON'T MOCK (Internal code we control):**
- Our own services, utilities, and components
- Logger utility (let it actually log during tests)
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Vue components (use real components when possible)
- Internal business logic

#### When Testing Components
- Use `@vue/test-utils` with minimal stubs
- Only stub Nuxt UI components if full Nuxt test setup isn't available
- Test user interactions and component behavior, not implementation details
- Focus on what users see and do, not internal method calls

#### When Testing Services
- Test the service with real dependencies where possible
- Mock only external system calls (`node-pty`, file system, network)
- Verify that services call logger appropriately (don't mock logger)
- Test error handling with real error scenarios

#### User Journey Testing Examples
- **Terminal Lifecycle**: Create ‚Üí Resize ‚Üí Write ‚Üí Destroy
- **Multi-terminal Management**: Create multiple ‚Üí Use independently ‚Üí Cleanup
- **Error Scenarios**: Handle write failures, resize failures, etc.
- **Integration Flows**: Component ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Service ‚Üí node-pty
