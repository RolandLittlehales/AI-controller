## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements Deep Dive

<requirements_gathering>
You are tasked with understanding a complex technical requirement or problem. Your goal is to gather comprehensive requirements and context before proposing any solutions.

**CRITICAL: Do not rush to solutions. Keep asking clarifying questions until you have complete understanding.**

**Key Questions Framework:**
1. **Core Problem Understanding:**
   - What exactly is the user trying to achieve?
   - What is the underlying business/technical problem being solved?
   - Why is this needed now? What triggered this requirement?

2. **User & Stakeholder Context:**
   - Who will use this feature/solution?
   - What are their current workflows and pain points?
   - What are their technical skill levels and constraints?

3. **Technical Context in Our Stack:**
   - How does this fit with our existing Nuxt 3 + terminal architecture?
   - What composables, stores, and services already exist that we can leverage?
   - What are the integration points with our WebSocket/terminal infrastructure?
   - How does this impact our git worktree and process management systems?

4. **Requirements Validation:**
   - What are the functional requirements (what must it do)?
   - What are the non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)?
   - What are the success criteria and failure modes to avoid?
   - What are the constraints (time, resources, compatibility)?

5. **Current State Analysis:**
   - What currently exists in this problem space?
   - What are the gaps between current state and desired state?
   - What workarounds are users currently employing?

**Continue this phase until you are 100% confident you understand all nuances. Ask follow-up questions. Probe deeper on any unclear aspects.**

**PHASE TRANSITION CRITERIA**: Only proceed to Phase 2 when:
- ✅ You can clearly articulate the core problem in 1-2 sentences
- ✅ You understand all functional and non-functional requirements
- ✅ You know how this integrates with our existing architecture
- ✅ You have identified success criteria and failure modes
- ✅ The user has confirmed your understanding is complete
</requirements_gathering>

### Phase 2: Ultra-Deep Analysis

<ultrathink>
Now that you have gathered requirements, engage in ultra-deep thinking about the problem space:

**Technical Architecture Analysis:**
- Map out how this integrates with our Nuxt 3 system architecture
- Identify all touchpoints: composables, stores, services, components, WebSocket handlers
- Understand data flows and Pinia state management implications
- Consider terminal process lifecycle and git worktree implications
- Analyze edge cases specific to our terminal/git/WebSocket architecture

**Solution Space Exploration:**
- What are ALL the possible fundamental approaches to solving this problem?
- How can we leverage our existing patterns vs building new ones?
- What are the trade-offs between different architectural approaches in our stack?
- How do different solutions align with our KISS/YAGNI development philosophy?
- What are the implementation complexities considering our specific tech stack?

**Context & Pattern Analysis:**
- How does this fit with our established Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + Pinia patterns?
- What can we leverage from our current terminal management infrastructure?
- Are there similar problems solved elsewhere in our codebase?
- What standards and conventions should we follow?
- How does this interact with our existing WebSocket/process management?

**Risk & Complexity Assessment:**
- What could go wrong with each potential approach in our environment?
- What are the migration/rollback strategies within our current architecture?
- How do we minimize blast radius if something fails?
- What are the long-term maintenance implications?
- What are the testing challenges with our Vitest + memfs patterns?

**Performance & Scalability Considerations:**
- How will this perform with multiple terminals and WebSocket connections?
- What are the memory and CPU implications?
- How does this scale with our git worktree approach?
- What are the bottlenecks and optimization opportunities?

**Think deeply about nuance and second-order effects specific to our architecture. Question all assumptions about our current patterns.**

**PHASE TRANSITION CRITERIA**: Only proceed to Phase 3 when:
- ✅ You have mapped all architectural integration points
- ✅ You have identified 3-5 fundamentally different solution approaches
- ✅ You understand the trade-offs and complexities of each approach
- ✅ You have considered performance, risk, and testing implications

### Phase 3: Solution Exploration

<solution_exploration>
Use the Task tool to spawn **3-5 different sub-agents**, each exploring a completely different architectural approach:

**Sub-Agent Instructions Template:**
```
You are a specialist architect exploring [SPECIFIC_APPROACH] for solving [PROBLEM] in our Nuxt 3 + Terminal management system.

**Your Technical Context:**
- Nuxt 3 (v3.17.7) with our established patterns and conventions
- Vue 3 Composition API with Pinia stores for state management  
- Terminal infrastructure: node-pty + xterm.js + WebSocket communication
- Git worktree management with simple-git
- Existing composables, services, and components to leverage
- Testing with Vitest + memfs, following our KISS/YAGNI philosophy

**Your Mission:**
Design a comprehensive solution using [SPECIFIC_APPROACH] that fits seamlessly into our architecture.

**What to deliver:**
1. **Detailed solution overview** explaining the core approach and principles
2. **Architecture integration** showing how this works with our existing patterns
3. **Implementation approach** with specific files, components, and services
4. **Code examples** in TypeScript following our conventions
5. **Trade-offs analysis** covering pros, cons, and limitations
6. **Resource requirements** (performance, memory, complexity)
7. **Risk assessment** for this specific approach
8. **Testing strategy** using our established Vitest patterns

**Focus exclusively on [SPECIFIC_APPROACH]. Do not compare to other approaches - that's my job.**

**Return a detailed architectural solution that someone could immediately evaluate for our codebase.**
```

**Typical Sub-Agent Specializations:**
- **Composable-Centric Approach** (Vue 3 composables as primary solution)
- **Service-Layer Approach** (Extend server services architecture)  
- **Component-Architecture Approach** (Vue component-driven solution)
- **WebSocket-Integration Approach** (Leverage existing terminal communication)
- **Store-First Approach** (Pinia state management as foundation)
- **Hybrid/Creative Approach** (Novel combination of our existing patterns)

**Each sub-agent returns comprehensive analysis covering:**
- Solution architecture and integration patterns
- Specific implementation with our tech stack
- Code examples matching our conventions  
- Performance and resource implications
- Testing approach with our tools
- Risk analysis within our context
</solution_exploration>

### Phase 4: Solution Synthesis & Comparison

<solution_synthesis>
After receiving all sub-agent reports, perform comprehensive analysis:

**1. Solution Analysis:**
- Evaluate each approach for technical merit and fit with our architecture
- Assess implementation complexity within our existing codebase
- Analyze maintainability and extensibility in our Nuxt 3 environment

**2. Multi-Dimensional Comparison:**
Create problem-specific comparison criteria that matter for this exact problem:

<matrix_design>
**Ultra-think about evaluation criteria**: What dimensions truly matter for THIS specific problem?

Consider criteria like:
- For UI/UX problems: "User Learning Curve", "Workflow Disruption", "Design System Fit"
- For performance problems: "Latency Impact", "Memory Footprint", "Concurrent User Support" 
- For integration problems: "Breaking Changes", "Migration Complexity", "Backward Compatibility"
- For developer experience: "Debugging Ease", "Testing Complexity", "Code Maintainability"
- For architecture problems: "Pattern Consistency", "Future Extensibility", "Technical Debt"

Design 5-8 criteria that are **specific to this problem domain** and will help decision-makers choose confidently.
</matrix_design>

**3. Risk & Trade-off Analysis:**
- Implementation risks within our tech stack
- Long-term maintenance implications
- Resource and performance trade-offs
- Testing and debugging complexity

**4. Architecture Fit Assessment:**
- How well each solution leverages our existing patterns
- Integration complexity with current composables/stores/services
- Consistency with our KISS/YAGNI philosophy

**Do NOT select a single winning solution. Instead, provide balanced analysis with ranked recommendations based on different criteria, allowing the user to make the final architectural decision.**
