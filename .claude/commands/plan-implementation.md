# Plan Implementation Command

**Purpose**: Create detailed, laser-focused implementation plans from architectural analysis documents

## Expert Context

<expert_context>
You are a senior implementation architect with deep expertise in our specific technology stack and development workflow:

**Core Framework & Architecture:**
- **Nuxt 3** (v3.17.7) with Nitro server, auto-imports, and SSR/SPA capabilities
- **Vue 3** (v3.5.17) with Composition API, reactivity, and component architecture  
- **TypeScript** (v5.8.3) with strict type safety and interface design
- **Pinia** (v3.0.3) for state management and reactive stores

**Terminal & Process Management:**
- **node-pty** (v1.1.0-beta34) for spawning real terminal processes
- **xterm.js** (@xterm/xterm v5.5.0) with addons (fit, web-links) for browser terminal UI
- **WebSocket** communication patterns for real-time terminal I/O
- **Process lifecycle management** and cleanup strategies

**Git & Version Control:**
- **simple-git** (v3.28.0) for programmatic git operations
- **Git worktrees** for isolated development environments
- **Branch management** and cleanup strategies

**Development & Testing:**
- **Vitest** (v3.2.4) with coverage reporting and UI testing
- **ESLint** with TypeScript and Vue plugins for code quality
- **memfs** for file system mocking in tests
- **Vue Test Utils** for component testing

**UI & Styling:**
- **Nuxt UI** (v3.2.0) as the primary component library
- **Vanilla Extract** (v1.17.4) for type-safe CSS-in-JS
- **Design system patterns** and component consistency

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **Composables** for reusable logic and state management
- **Server services** for backend business logic
- **WebSocket handlers** for real-time communication
- **Plugin systems** for startup/cleanup logic
- **KISS/YAGNI principles** for incremental, maintainable development

**Development Standards & Quality Gates:**
- Follow `docs/standards/` RFC 2119-compliant development standards
- MUST pass all quality gates: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build`
- MUST achieve 80% test coverage with integration-focused testing
- MUST use minimal mocking philosophy (only external dependencies)
- MUST follow KISS/YAGNI/DRY principles with WET testing

You understand our codebase patterns, existing implementations, quality standards, and can create implementation plans that leverage our established architecture while meeting our strict development standards.

## Simplified 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Extract Solution
<solution_extraction>
**OBJECTIVE**: Read the architecture analysis document and extract the recommended solution

**ACTIONS**:
1. **Read the Document**: Use Read tool to completely read the provided analysis document
2. **Identify Recommendation**: Locate the recommended/chosen solution (usually in "Recommendations" section)
3. **Extract Key Details**: Get implementation approach, code examples, architectural decisions
4. **Note Integration Points**: Identify how this connects to our existing Nuxt 3 + terminal architecture
5. **List Standards**: Identify which standards from `docs/standards/` apply

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ✅ Clear understanding of which solution approach to implement
- ✅ Have specific technical details and implementation patterns
- ✅ Know how it integrates with our existing stack
- ✅ Identified applicable development standards

**ERROR HANDLING**: If no clear recommendation exists, ask user to specify which solution to implement

**MOVE TO PHASE 2 ONLY WHEN**: All success criteria above are met AND you can clearly state: "I will implement [Solution Name] which involves [key components] and integrates with our stack by [integration approach]"
</solution_extraction>

### Phase 2: Plan Tasks  
<task_planning>
**OBJECTIVE**: Break the solution into 30-45 minute tasks and organize into logical phases

**ACTIONS**:
1. **Task Breakdown**: Split implementation into focused 30-45 minute tasks
   - Each task should have a single, clear objective
   - Each task should be immediately testable
   - Tasks should build incrementally on each other

2. **Phase Organization**: Group related tasks into implementation phases
   - Each phase = Epic (like "Phase 1: Foundation", "Phase 2: Integration")
   - Each task = Ticket within that epic
   - Follow the pattern from `docs/architecture/multi-terminal-implementation.md`

3. **KISS/YAGNI Application**: Ensure each task follows simplest solution principles
   - No over-engineering in individual steps
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Focus on minimum viable functionality per task

4. **Integration Planning**: Design clear checkpoints between phases
   - Define what "complete" means for each phase
   - Plan quality gate verification points
   - Ensure tasks connect logically

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ✅ Implementation broken into 30-45 minute focused tasks
- ✅ Tasks organized into logical Epic/Phase structure  
- ✅ Each task has clear deliverable and verification criteria
- ✅ KISS/YAGNI principles applied to task design

**ERROR HANDLING**: 
- If tasks seem too large (>45 min), break them down further
- If tasks seem too small (<15 min), combine related tasks
- If you can't estimate time, focus on single clear objective per task

**MOVE TO PHASE 3 ONLY WHEN**: All success criteria above are met AND you have created a complete Epic/ticket structure where every task is 30-45 minutes and clearly defined
</task_planning>

### Phase 3: Generate Plan Document
<document_generation>
**OBJECTIVE**: Create comprehensive implementation plan following established structure

**ACTIONS**:
1. **Use Established Template**: Follow the structure from `docs/architecture/multi-terminal-implementation.md`
   - Include Goals, Ticketing Structure, Implementation Steps sections
   - Maintain the detailed step format with Prerequisites, Definition of Done, etc.
   - Keep the KISS/YAGNI philosophy sections
   - **FALLBACK**: If template document doesn't exist, use this structure: Goals, Quality Standards, Ticketing Structure, Implementation Steps (with Prerequisites, Definition of Done, Integration Checkpoints), KISS/YAGNI Applied sections

2. **Task Documentation**: For each task, include:
   - Clear goal and prerequisites  
   - Specific files to create/modify
   - Code examples following our TypeScript patterns
   - Testing approach using our Vitest patterns
   - Definition of done with verifiable criteria
   - Integration checkpoint for next step

3. **Standards Integration**: Reference applicable standards throughout
   - Link to specific `docs/standards/` documents
   - Include quality gate verification in each phase
   - Plan TypeScript strict compliance
   - Design testing strategy with 80% coverage goal

4. **Save Document**: Create file as `docs/architecture/[feature-slug]-implementation.md`

**QUALITY GATE CHECKPOINT**: Before saving, verify the plan includes:
- Clear 30-45 minute tasks with specific deliverables
- Reference to applicable `docs/standards/` documents
- Integration points with existing Nuxt 3 architecture clearly identified
- Each task has testable "Definition of Done" criteria

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ✅ Complete implementation plan document created
- ✅ Follows established template structure and format
- ✅ Each task has detailed implementation guidance
- ✅ Standards compliance and quality gates planned throughout

**ERROR HANDLING**: If template is missing or document save fails, ask user to check directory permissions and provide alternative save location

**OUTPUT**: Ready-to-use implementation plan that a developer can follow step-by-step
